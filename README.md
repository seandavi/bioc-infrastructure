# bioconductor-infrastructure

Documentation for the infrastructure behind bioconductor.org: what runs today,
what replaces it, and the contracts between the repos that do the work.

The rendered site is the point — this repo is its source. It is deliberately
separate from the repos it documents, so that no one of them is the privileged
place where the estate gets described.

## Status

Every status light across the repo family, in one place. **Green means the
check ran and its blocking assertions passed — not that there were no
findings.** The report-only checks (accessibility on bioc-website PRs, the
random-sample leg of the install canary) stay green while carrying findings;
each run's step summary shows them, and the link/a11y checks also upload a
full report artifact. Red means broken or stale — click through for the
failing run.

no stable latest-artifact URL). If it's ever down, the artifact is on the
latest run under the links badge.

## Rendering locally

```sh
quarto preview     # live reload on :4200
quarto render      # static build -> _site/
```

Nothing else is required: no credentials, no services, no data fetch. Every
page is prose and diagrams.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.qmd` | The estate map — start here |
| `adr/` | Architecture decision records: why things are the way they are |
| `_quarto.yml` | Site structure; the sidebar is the table of contents |

## Publishing

`.github/workflows/docs.yml` renders and deploys to GitHub Pages on every push
to `main`. There is no draft state: **writing here is writing in public.**

That was true before this repo existed — the site was public while its source
repo was private — and it stays true now for a simpler reason. See
[`adr/0001`](adr/0001-public-docs-site-with-a-publication-boundary.md).
